Some thanking should be done.

Thank You coderanger(from #trac on irc.freenode.net) for helping me write
that pretty huge regex to grab gettext calls on genshi templates, which
fortunately is not being used.

Thank You matt_good(from #trac and #python-genshi on irc.freenode.net) for
making it so easy to find gettext calls on genshi templates using python's
opcode module.

Thank You TurboGears(http://turbogears.org/) for providing some great ideas
on how to build this package, namely parts of your admi18n toolbox, and your
commands architecture.

Thank You pjenvey, benbangert and some others that I forgot the names/nicks
(from #pylons on irc.freenode.net) for introducing and explaining some of
the gettext goodness to me.

Thank You Pylons(http://pylonshq.com/) for being such a wonderful framework
that does not force me to use an SQL backend just to run it(sorry TurboGears
:) that was the reason why I didn't invest in you)

And finally, Thank's to All those that I forgot.

Pedro Algarvio, aka, s0undt3ch.
